# Cryptography-algorithms
The programm allows you to:
- Test Scrambler work;
- Use XOR-cipher;
- Use Hill-cipher; 
- Use Feistel-cipher;
- Use DES-cipher in many encryption modes (like ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, BC, PCBC, OFBNLF, EDE modes; simple double encryption; Davies-Price encryption mode; triple algorithm with three keys);
- Generate prime numbers with specific size;
- Search for the first 100 primitive roots of a number;
- See the demonstration of Diffie-Hellman Protocol;
- Use RSA-cipher;
- Use Digital signature.

This program  was made by me and Alexander Pozdniakov ( https://github.com/0awawa0 ).
